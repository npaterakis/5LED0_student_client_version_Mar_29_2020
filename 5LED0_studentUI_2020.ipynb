    "# Participation of a wind power producer in day-ahead electricity markets\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "**This material was developed by:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Nikolaos Paterakis (market participation algorithm) | n.paterakis@tue.nl\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Juan Giraldo Chavarriaga (the EMGA platform) | j.s.giraldo.chavarriaga@tue.nl\n",

    "----------------\n",
    "This notebook provides a simple, yet quite comprehensive, pipeline for preparing bids for a price-taker wind producer participating \n",
    "in the day-ahead electricity market by considering the effects of the imbalance mechanism. \n",
    "\n",
    "The stochastic programming model is based on the following book (which you can access by using TU/e VPN):\n",
    "> A. J. Conejo, M. Carri√≥n, J. M. Morales, [*Decision making under uncertainty in electricity markets*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-7421-1), Springer US, 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original model day-ahead market prices, imbalance price ratios and available wind energy are all considered to be uncertain variables. For simplicity, in this case we are considering that day-ahead market prices are perfectly known and that imbalance price ratios are given by a fixed set of scenarios for every trading day. Your task is to generate a scenario set for available wind energy for the next trading day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, without loss of generality and in order to simplify data handling, we consider that the day-ahead market is cleared excactly at the beggining of the day of interest (midnight). In reality, the decisions have to be made several hours before the beggining of the day of interest as it was discussed during the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is recommended to change?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, you can modify any parts of the code. Nevertheless, it is recommended that you experiment with the following parts of the pipeline:\n",
    "1. Use different regression models that are readily available in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), feature selection and data processing techniques. As it was mentioned during the introductory lecture, the linear regression model is not necessarily the most suitable one for predicting/generating scenarios for available wind energy. Depending on how fast your computer is, you might as well experiment with other machine learning models (e.g., [Keras](https://keras.io/) is a popular neural network module -- in that case, the [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) backend is strongly recommended). \n",
    "2. Modify the risk-aversion factor $\\beta$. \n",
    "3. Change the number of scenarios generated for the available wind energy.\n",
    "4. You can generate a set of non-equiprobable scenarios by reducing the initially generated set of scenarios in terms of, e.g., a [clustering approach](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html).\n",
    "5. You can reduce the number of scenarios that are provided for the imbalance prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions to prepare a bid for each trading day:**\n",
    "1. Download the most recent data from the game platform (https://sa-emga.herokuapp.com/)\n",
    "2. Update the forecasts/scenario set \n",
    "3. Execute the optimization model \n",
    "4. Upload the .csv file containing the bid quantities for each time period on the platform \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/FLOWCHART.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 350px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Known caveats:**\n",
    "1. The variable $periodsPast$ triggers an error if reduced to less than 144. There is no problem with reducing the number of features by means of a feature selection technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure that you have installed the following libraries:**\n",
    "- numpy \n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- xlrd\n",
    "- openpyxl\n",
    "- scipy\n",
    "- statsmodels\n",
    "- matplotlib\n",
    "- scikit-learn\n",
    "- pyomo\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, these libraries will install all the necessary dependencies. Nonetheless, be alert for errors that indicate that specific packages might be missing and install them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Also, it is assumed that you have installed the [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/) solver.**\n",
